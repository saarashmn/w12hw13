this code generates a dataset of 500 points from a mixture of three Gaussians
and then implements k-mean clustering
density of this dataset using either the kernel density estimation (KDE) or histogram methods.  here we use KDE
this code will produce a plot showing the KDE estimate and the dataset together.
